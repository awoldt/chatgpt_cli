Basic go program that lets you interact with ChatGPT through the terminal. Conversations are not stored anywhere. Each chat initiated will store the entire conversations context so you can get answers based on previous questions asked.
## Installation

Simply run the main.go file and a "config.json" will be generated in the root of your project. Add your OpenAI API key to this config and start using! You can also select which model you want to use in the config (defaults to gpt-4.1-nano).
